1. What is the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class?

Abstract base classes are classes in which one or more methods within that class is declared but not defined (an example would be a virtual function where a method is defined in the base class but declared in its derived class).

A concrete class on the other hand is a class in which the method(s) exists within the class itself without the "help" of a derived class.

2. Identify the functions that shadow functions of the same name in your solution?

ChequingAccount::credit() shadows Account::credit() in the main() function,
ChequingAccount::debit() shadows Account::debit() in the main() function,
ChequingAccount::monthEnd() shadows SavingsAccount::monthEnd() in the main() function,
 and ChequingAccount::display() shadows SavingsAccount::display().

3. Explain what have you learned in this workshop.

I have learned to properly derive classes from base classes and how to use the methods defined in an abstract class within the derived class
